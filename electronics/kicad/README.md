# Jacdac library and reference designs for KiCad

A Jacdac [library and module template](https://github.com/hardwaremonkey/jacdac) design for KiCad have been created and made available by [Matt Oppenheim](https://github.com/hardwaremonkey). Thanks Matt!

We plan to have more KiCad Jacdac design examples in due course.
