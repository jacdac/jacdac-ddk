# Jacdac Design Blocks for EAGLE


## Design Blocks

Routing the [Jacdac PCB edge connector footprints](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/design/examples/eagle-library) can be challenging. To speed up design, we provide EAGLE design blocks with pre-routed footprints for three different outline variants INNE, OUTIE and ANY. To import these design blocks, select the Eagle toolbox icon in the shape of a lego block in your schematic or board view and then select one of the three deasign block variants.
