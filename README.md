# Jacdac Device Development Kit (DDK) Reference Materials

**Partner Preview: Jacdac is currently in preview. If you would like to join as a pre-release test partner, please email jacdac-tap@microsoft.com.**

## Introduction

This repository contains reference materials for creators of [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) devices. More specifically, it has technical drawings, part libraries and device designs (schematics and layout files). In conjunction with the [Jacdac device design documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/ddk/) and our [Jacdac firmware repositories](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/ddk/firmware/), these materials form the Jacdac device design kit (DDK). The DDK contains everything necessary to design and manufacture [Jacdac devices](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/devices/).

Please also refer to discussions at https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/discussions and note that issues are tracked on https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/issues.
