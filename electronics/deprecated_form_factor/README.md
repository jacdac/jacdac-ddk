# Deprecated design files for Jacdac

Prior to developing and finalising the Jacdac connector and EC30 form factor, we experimented with many different designs. These folders contain Jacdac libraries and designs from a previous iteration where we used smaller mounting holes and had less standard module shapes and sizes. These designs are all deprecated butwe made them available in case parts of them are useful for referring to. 

These designs are mostly in Altium Designer, but also KiCad and Eagle. There are PDFs of schematics and layouts in most cases, so it should be easy to browse them. The schematic PDFs generated by Altium contain meta-data that can be viewed by clicking on elements in the schematic **when using Acrobat**.
